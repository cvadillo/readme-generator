## Description

ReadMe Generator is a Node.js application that creates a README for the user from the terminal command prompt. The project user MIT's inquirer to get information from the user, and then passes it through the FS node module to write the README to the 'dist' folder. The application requires inquirer and fs node modules to run properly. In fact, this README was created with the application! How cool is that?!
